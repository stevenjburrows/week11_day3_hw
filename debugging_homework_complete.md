Answer the following questions:
### What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
To stop the code from executing at a certain point so you can inspect what is going on.

### Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
No, it stops before the line of code is run.

### How do we debug the next line of code?
you click on the icon to step pver to the next step in the code

### What does the step into command do?
When you call a method you use this to go into that method and continue debugging from there rather than  gooing onto the next line of code in the file.

### What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
Evaluate expression only works on one line of code and you don't need a ; at the end of he line.  Evaluate code fragment is for multiple lines of code and needs a ; at the end just like normal Java.  It also keeps a variable alive with whatever you have stored in it until you close the window.
